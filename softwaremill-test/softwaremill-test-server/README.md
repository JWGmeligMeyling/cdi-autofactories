# SoftwareMill Test Server

Provides server for testing.

You can easily start the server, setup it with Responders, send some requests and receive response.
There is LoggingAndRememberingResponder which logs received requests to console and stores data about them, so in your test you
can run component sending requests and later verify if the requests sent were as expected.

Look to tests for examples of use.
